Filo regression tests. Run with:  python3 test_filo.py

The integrity tests are the important ones. Filo's single promise is that a
"better-made option" is genuinely better made. If those tests ever go red,
something is recommending an item we cannot vouch for — treat that as broken,
not as a failing test to adjust.
